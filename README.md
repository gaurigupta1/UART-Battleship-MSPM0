# UART-Battleship-MSPM0
This project includes two custom PCBs incorporating MSPM0 microcontrollers, HC-12 UART wireless modules, DAC-driven speakers, ADC-connected slide potentiometers, physical switches, LEDs, and HiLetGo LCD displays. Included is embedded C firmware to enable real-time, wireless two-player Battleship gameplay between the two PCBs.
